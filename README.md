# ElasticSearchMadeEasy
Thin layer on Elastic Search api to make your life easy

## How to use

Currently you can clone the project locally and use the generated jar by locally building it.


## Pending task

- Setup build and release mechanism
- Use Unirest callback mechanism instead of custom ESearch interface
- Find/Build embedded elastic search server to use with unit tests 

Note : Currently tests will only work if you're running local instance of elastic search or provide url to existing elasticsearch instance. 
I'm using [Elasticsearch-http-basic] (https://github.com/Asquera/elasticsearch-http-basic) for authentication. Refer documentation given in the link to use the same.
